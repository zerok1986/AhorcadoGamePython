# AhorcadoGamePython
This is a free improvement of a Word Guesser game proposed as a Final project in Stanford's Code In Place 2021 course . This game is called AHORCADO GAME (in Python, of course!), and it can take a file with a single word for each row as a list of words for the game.

Feel free to update the file variable with a .txt of your own! 
(Remember! Only a word for row!)

Easy to use INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Download all files from this repository
2) Be sure you download at least one of the .txt files (or create one of your own) and store it in the same folder where you stored ahorcadoGame.py
4) Open the ahorcadoGame.py in an IDE or shell of your covenience
5) GET SOME FUN !!
