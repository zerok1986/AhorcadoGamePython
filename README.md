# AhorcadoGamePython
This is a free improvement of a Word Guesser game proposed as a Final project in Stanford's Code In Place 2021 course . This game is called AHORCADO GAME (in Python, of course!), and it can take a file with a single word for each row as a list of words for the game.

Feel free to update the file variable with a .txt of your own! 
(Remember! Only a word for row!)
